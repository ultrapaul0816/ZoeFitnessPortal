# System Architecture
## Frontend
Built with React and TypeScript, using Vite, shadcn/ui (Radix UI), and TailwindCSS. State management uses TanStack Query, and routing is handled by wouter. Forms use React Hook Form with Zod validation. The UI/UX emphasizes a premium visual aesthetic with a pink brand theme, gradients, rounded corners, and mobile responsiveness. Key features include advanced tab navigation, an FAQ, enhanced program headers, and consistent blue styling for video links. Performance is optimized with lazy loading (React.lazy(), Suspense) for heavy pages and dynamic imports for libraries like jsPDF. Images are compressed client-side before upload to optimize performance. Mobile UX is enhanced with accessible toast notifications, scrollable dialogs, and floating action buttons.

## Backend
An Express.js and TypeScript RESTful API with a modular route structure, centralized error handling, and request logging. It uses session-based authentication with role-based access control. WhatsApp Community support access is duration-based. The admin panel includes a comprehensive user management system with separate view/edit dialogs, dashboard statistics (Total, Active, Expiring Soon members), detailed controls for program enrollment, WhatsApp access, and account management, and a comprehensive Analytics Dashboard. The Analytics Dashboard provides macro-level insights into demographics (country distribution, postpartum stages, Instagram handles collected), engagement metrics (active/dormant users by time period), program performance (completion rates, workout statistics, mood/challenge ratings), community health (posts, likes, comments, participation rates, top categories and contributors), and business metrics (WhatsApp adoption, program completions, average completion time). The Email Campaign Analytics provides campaign-specific insights including total campaigns sent, total email opens, average open rates, template performance statistics (sends, opens, open rates by template type), and recent campaign history with detailed metrics. All analytics visualizations use recharts with bar charts, pie charts, and responsive layouts. Account creation includes mandatory acceptance of terms and health disclaimers. Promotional content visibility for WhatsApp support is dynamically controlled based on user subscription status.

## Data Storage
PostgreSQL, accessed via Drizzle ORM, is the primary database. It stores users, fitness programs, workouts, enrollments, community posts, and notifications. User profiles store extensive personalization data. Critical user profile data (country, bio, Instagram handle, postpartum weeks, last login) is persisted in the database, taking precedence over localStorage, with a one-time migration logic for existing localStorage data. Program enrollments track `completionPercentage` and `completedAt`.

## Authentication & Authorization
Session-based authentication with express-session and PostgreSQL storage (connect-pg-simple), providing persistent 30-day sessions with secure HTTP-only cookies. Bcrypt-hashed passwords (cost factor 10) with strength validation. Includes a transitional migration guard for legacy passwords. Role-based access control differentiates users and administrators. Mandatory acceptance of terms and health disclaimers is integrated into the login flow. Rate limiting protects login (15 attempts/15min), password reset (3 attempts/15min), and admin endpoints. Robust input validation is implemented for phone numbers, emails, dates, names, file uploads (mime type, size, single file), and WhatsApp duration. User email fields are read-only to prevent client-side modifications. One-time migration of localStorage profile data to database on first session login. Dashboard verifies session on mount and redirects to login if session is invalid or expired.

**Login with OTP**: Users can log in via a 6-digit OTP code sent to their email. The login page now features two equally prominent buttons: "Sign In with Password" and "Sign In with Email Code" (OTP). After entering the 6-digit code, users are logged in directly. A "Reset password instead?" option is available for those who need to change their password. OTP codes expire in 10 minutes and are stored in the `password_reset_codes` table. The system auto-accepts terms/disclaimer when logging in via OTP to streamline the process.

**Activity Tracking**: The system tracks user activities (logins, workout completions) in the `activity_logs` database table. The admin dashboard's Overview tab includes a real-time Activity Feed showing recent member activities with timestamps, color-coded by activity type (blue for logins, green for workout completions, pink for workout starts). The feed auto-refreshes every 30 seconds.

## Technical Implementations
The application provides a 6-week program with detailed exercises, coach notes, and YouTube video integration. Content is organized into collapsible, gradient-themed sections. Features include a "What's Next Tab" with a PDF progress tracker, a modernized Nutrition section, extensive profile personalization, and real-time profile completeness tracking with a progress banner. Program access is managed via both purchase and admin enrollment records. A "Progress Tracker" tab allows secure before/after photo uploads via Cloudinary. An Instagram-style Community Feed supports photo uploads, categories, week-based filtering, likes, comments, and Instagram sharing, with full CRUD operations and Cloudinary integration.

**Database-Driven Workout Content**: Workout program content is now stored in PostgreSQL with two tables: `workout_program_content` (program metadata, coach notes, colors, equipment as JSONB) and `workout_content_exercises` (individual exercises with sectionType, orderNum, name, reps, URL). A hybrid fetch approach is used where the frontend tries the database API first (`/api/workout-content`) and falls back to static data (`client/src/data/workoutPrograms.ts`) if unavailable. Admin users can manage workout content through the "Workouts" tab in the admin panel, including editing program details, exercise names, reps, video URLs, and adding/deleting exercises.

Email campaign management includes a template library with 5 reusable templates (Welcome, Re-engagement, Midpoint Motivation, Completion Celebration, Complete Your Signup), dynamic variable replacement, email open tracking via pixel tracking, audience targeting with filters (including Pending Signup filter for incomplete registrations), test email functionality, campaign scheduling for future delivery, and a comprehensive Email Analytics Dashboard with performance metrics, template statistics, and campaign history visualization.

Email automation includes 8 trigger-based rules: Welcome Email (user signup), Completion Celebration (program completion), Re-engagement emails at 7/14/21/30 days of inactivity, and Incomplete Signup Reminder (3 days after account creation if Terms & Conditions or Health Disclaimer not accepted). Automation rules can be enabled/disabled and customized by admin.
